## Contributing To Code

### Pre-Requistes

Ensure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed to kick off your development journey smoothly. Check our setup guide for detailed instructions.

### Installation

Clone this repo and install it for development:

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/smallcloudai/refact
pip install -e refact/
```

To run the whole server, use:

```commandline
python -m self_hosting_machinery.watchdog.docker_watchdog
```

For debugging, it's better to run HTTP server and inference processes separately, for example in
separate terminals.

```commandline
python -m self_hosting_machinery.webgui.webgui
DEBUG=1 python -m self_hosting_machinery.inference.inference_worker --model wizardlm/7b
```

That should be enough to get started!

### Fork the Repository

If you plan to make changes, you need your own fork of the project -- clone that instead of
the main repo. Once you have your changes ready, commit them and push them to your fork. After
that you should be able to create a pull request for the main repository.

### Install Linguist

For fine tuning, files go through a pre filter. Follow instructions in
https://github.com/smallcloudai/linguist
to install it.

If you don't plan to debug fine tuning, you can skip this step.
